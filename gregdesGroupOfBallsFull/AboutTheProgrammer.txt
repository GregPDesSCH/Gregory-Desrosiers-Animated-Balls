Gregory Desrosiers is a full-time student at Champlain College Saint-Lambert,
an English college outside Montreal, Canada. Pursuing in Computer Science and
Mathematics, Desrosiers is working on his goal to becoming a full-time
computer game producer and also being a director for his development team.

He was born in September 1993 in Montreal and has been living in the province
for more than 19 years. He was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome in February
1996 and therefore was put through a special education program for preschoolers
in 1998, organized by the Riverside School Board in Saint-Lambert. (They are
now located on the property of Desrosiers' high school, Heritage Regional
High School. The board still runs the school.)

Desrosiers started learning JAVA in August 2011 in one of his first college
courses who was taught by a senior teacher. Although initial exercises were
tricky and Desrosiers got overwhelmed, he was able to achieve 91% as his final
grade.

His highest performance was recorded at 96%, done in May 2012 after completing
his second JAVA course.

Desrosiers had earned several rewards and even commenced on projects of his
own. He was awarded the School Champion Medal for the 2009 Canadian
Mathematics Competition Pascal Contest, a $100 high school bursary for his
performance in a lip sync of Justin Bieber's Pray, as well as the principal's
award from his elementary school graduation in June 2006.

He also wrote his first ever e-book, The Asperger Computer, in March 2013, as
a spinoff to his original college speech on Asperger's. It was rewritten and
expanded in June 2013 because of marketing issues.

Today, Desrosiers is taking his fourth JAVA course at college as well as
four other courses. He has interest in wanting to learn other programming
languages such as Visual Basic and C++, though he most likely wants to
start writing a few new e-books to expand his audience first.
